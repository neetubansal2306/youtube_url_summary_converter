YouTube URL Summary Converter is a web application that allows users to generate concise summaries of YouTube videos by simply pasting the video URL. 

The application extracts key information from the video, including its title, description, and subtitles (if available), and uses natural language processing to create a brief and meaningful summary. 

It is designed to save users time by providing quick insights without watching the full video.

The project can be enhanced with features like language support, keyword extraction, and export options for the summaries.
